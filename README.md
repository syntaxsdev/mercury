# Mercury (Trading Strategy Management System)

This system is designed to manage, monitor, and measure trading strategies by providing tools for health checks, logging, and operational control, such as pausing or resuming strategies. It integrates a data pipeline that allows strategies to access both internal and external data sources seamlessly. By acting as a centralized interface, it enables independent operation, making it a versatile component for any trading platform.

### This is not a risk management system. Please refer to [vital-risk-engine](https://github.com/syntaxsdev/vital-risk-engine)
This manages the underlying strategies running code themselves into one platform.
